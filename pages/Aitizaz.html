    <p>Believe it or not this kid on the left is me, I know haven’t changed much apart from my age!!! When this picture was taken it was roughly when my dad got my first console the Nintendo DSi for my birthday and a remote-control car. You might be thinking as to why I am mentioning this but hang on I will explain why right now. Fast forward a couple of months later my R.C car broke and decided to fix it myself, so I grabbed my dad’s toolbox and started dismantling the car and found a motor, battery and a chip board from there I dismantled the controller and was fascinated by how such a small board can control a car. This sparked my interest in technology and from there I would always dismantle anything technology related and would research what each component did.</p>
