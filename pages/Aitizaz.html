    <p>Well you clicked on this link to know everything about me, well not everything just some things. You are still
      reading, this oh well I guess I have to tell you a little something about me.</p>
    <p class="mid">Let’s start off with my name which is Aitizaz, and I welcome you to this page about me. </p>

      <p>Believe it or not this kid on the left is me, I know haven’t changed much apart from my age!!! When this
        picture was taken it was roughly when my dad got my first console the Nintendo DSi for my birthday and a
        remote-control car. You might be thinking as to why I am mentioning this but hang on I will explain why right
        now. Fast forward a couple of months later my R.C car broke and decided to fix it myself, so I grabbed my dad’s
        toolbox and started dismantling the car and found a motor, battery and a chip board from there I dismantled the
        controller and was fascinated by how such a small board can control a car. This sparked my interest in
        technology and from there I would always dismantle anything technology related and would research what each
        component did.
        <br>
        <strong>Fun fact:</strong>
        <italics>I tried to take my dad’s laptop apart when I was 9 and let’s just say that dad never got to see
          that computer ever again. </italics>
      </p>

      <p>My first experience with 'programming' wasn’t really a program language but a software called ‘Scratch’ where
        you
        drag and drop things with minor editing to create a game in which I did and was interested in making a game
        where you hit a bunch of circles which outputs the sounds of drums as I was in a band in primary school playing
        the drums.</p>
