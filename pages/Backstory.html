        <h1>Backstory</h1>
        <p>Hopefully, you read all of our pages to learn all about us. If not, go back and look at those!!! But if you
            already have then here is a little story of how we became the 1023MB</p>
        <br>
        <h2>How Aitizaz Met James</h2>
        <p>I met James on a night out at K2 Karaoke (Manchester) where I was a with a mate and saw the most magnificent
            voice ever known to mankind it was a voice of angel which for some reason made me want to go and find this
            angel of a voice. And there he was, James standing there with his eyes closed singing and moving to the beat
            of the song it was almost as if the song was made by him. I was thinking of starting a band as I was good
            with drums but to have the voice of an angel which I know will not be found elsewhere I had to get him on
            board. When James came off the stage, I had to tell him that I thought his voice was too good to be true and
            though that it was autotune but really wasn’t and you can be rest assured that his cheeks turned bright
            tomato red. I asked him if he could join our band, and at first, he politely declined but I kept on
            insisting that a voice like his needs to be recognised and that he won’t regret it and then only then he
            agreed. Now this was a start of something great and I knew it, all we needed was a guitarist.</p>

        <h2>How James and Aitizaz met Owen</h2>
        <p>How I met Owen was a very random and I believe that he was the guitarist we needed for our band. A little
            backstory, we had a few guitarists trying up for our band and they weren’t all that and were missing
            something that James and I could not place our finger one as when we would play with the try outs there
            wasn’t that sense of harmony. Back to how I met Owen, it was on a Friday evening, and I thought why not go
            to the local thrift store and check what instruments or something cool they might have and when I entered I
            saw a new person in the store that I had not seen before and they were at the instruments section and I was
            heading there as well so I thought maybe it is someone buying their first instrument but when I reached he
            strummed the guitar and when he was playing it, it was as if I struck gold it was Owen the one we was
            looking for and I had to have him in our band. I used my similar techniques of charming and convincing to
            join our band and at first, he was reluctant as he didn’t really think that he was good but I knew that when
            he joins our band he will sound amazing as what had to offer and how he played was that something James and
            I was missing. I called Owen over to see if James agrees and after a practice session, he agreed that Owen
            was the last jigsaw piece to our puzzle.</p>
